# IOT-Project
Github repository for IOT Project,

This project will let a user control when they wish to feed their pet from a remote location, as long as they have access to Wi-Fi.
They will connect to the Arduino Yun through Blynk via their unique authentication code.
They then simply press the button to have the feeder open and close automatically, dispensing the food for their pet.
